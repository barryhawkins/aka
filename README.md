# README for AKA

## Purpose
AKA exists to allow players with multiple characters in World of Warcraft to be more easily recognized by those they communicate with, regardless of which character they are currently playing.


## Quick Start
Here are the steps to have the name of your main or whatever people know you by showing up on all your alts for a given faction on a given realm:

1. Log in to an alt on the desired faction and realm in WoW.
2. Type `/aka guild` into the chat bar and press the Enter key.
3. Type `/aka main <name>` (where name is the actual name of your main without brackets) into the chat bar and press the Enter key.

After these three steps, you should see whatever value you entered for main appear in parentheses after your current character name in guild chat messages for any character in that faction on that realm. If you are logged in as a character with the name matching the value you entered for main, AKA will automatically leave out the parenthetical display of the same name.

NOTE: Technically you could log in to your main and perform steps two and three. However, if your set main to be the actual name of your main (as many do), then testing the appearance of the parenthetical aka will require logging out and then logging over to an alt.

README for Moniker
Author: Barry Hawkins (Taurendur @ US-Whisperwind)

Purpose
---------------
Moniker exists to allow individual persons playing multiple characters within the World of Warcraft to be more easily recognized by those they communicate with, regardless of which character they are currently playing.


Overview
---------------
Moniker is an interface AddOn for World of Warcraft (WoW), the MMORPG produced by Blizzard Entertainment. It is inspired by the Identity AddOn that has filled a similar role over the years. Identity and its successor Identity-2 have been loving shepherded by Ferusnox and UltraNurd, and we thank them for their years of service to the WoW community.


Quick Start
---------------
I freely admit that I usually want an AddOn to be up and running as soon as possible so I can get back in game. I am certain that I am not alone in that respect. Here are the steps to have the name of your main or whatever people know you by showing up on all your alts for a given faction on a given realm:

1.) Log in to an alt on the desired faction and realm in WoW.
2.) Type "/mnk guild" into the chat bar and press the Enter key.
3.) Type "/mnk main <name>" (where name is the actual name of your main without brackets) into the chat bar and press the Enter key.

After these three steps, you should see whatever value you entered for main appear in parentheses after your current character name in guild chat messages for any character in that faction on that realm. If you are logged in as a character with the name matching the value you entered for main, Moniker will automatically leave out the parenthetical display of the same name.


Usage
---------------
The following commands are used in the input field of the chat window in the WoW client.

/mnk - Displays basic help information
/mnk help - Displays basic help information
/mnk guild - Toggle display of moniker on and off for guild chat for the current faction on the current realm
/mnk whisper - Toggle display of moniker on/off for whispers for the current faction on the current realm
/mnk main <name> - Sets the name of your main for the current faction on the current realm
/mnk on - Enable the Moniker AddOn for the current realm
/mnk off - Disable the Moniker AddOn for the current realm
/mnk reset - Reset the current faction on the current realm to the default values

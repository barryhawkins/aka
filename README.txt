README for AKA
Author: Barry Hawkins (Taurendur @ US-Earthen Ring)

Purpose
---------------
AKA exists to allow individual persons playing multiple characters within the World of Warcraft to be more easily recognized by those they communicate with, regardless of which character they are currently playing.


Overview
---------------
AKA is an interface AddOn for World of Warcraft (WoW), the MMORPG produced by Blizzard Entertainment. It is inspired by the Identity AddOn that has filled a similar role over the years. Identity and its successor Identity-2 have been lovingly shepherded by Ferusnox and UltraNurd, and we thank them for their years of service to the WoW community.


Quick Start
---------------
I freely admit that I usually want an AddOn to be up and running as soon as possible so I can get back in game. I am certain that I am not alone in that respect. Here are the steps to have the name of your main or whatever people know you by showing up on all your alts for a given faction on a given realm:

1.) Log in to an alt on the desired faction and realm in WoW.
2.) Type "/aka guild" into the chat bar and press the Enter key.
3.) Type "/aka main <name>" (where name is the actual name of your main without brackets) into the chat bar and press the Enter key.

After these three steps, you should see whatever value you entered for main appear in parentheses after your current character name in guild chat messages for any character in that faction on that realm. If you are logged in as a character with the name matching the value you entered for main, AKA will automatically leave out the parenthetical display of the same name.

NOTE: Technically you could log in to your main and perform steps two and three. However, if your set main to be the actual name of your main (as many do), then testing the appearance of the parenthetical aka will require logging out and then logging over to an alt.


Usage
---------------
The following commands are used in the input field of the chat window in the WoW client.

/aka - Displays basic help information
